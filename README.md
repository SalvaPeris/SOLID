## Single Responsibility Principle
Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.
<br>
<br>
## Open-Closed Principle
The Open-Closed Principle requires that classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.
<br>
<br>
## Liskov Substitution Principle
The Liskov Substitution Principle states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.
<br>
<br>
## Interface Segregation Principle
Segregation means keeping things separated, and the Interface Segregation Principle is about separating the interfaces.
<br>
<br>
## Dependency Inversion Principle
The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.
